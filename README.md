# Neural Networks in JavaScript

A hands-on educational project for learning and visualizing neural networks using vanilla JavaScript.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of neural networks from scratch, including:

- **Single and Multi-Input Networks** - Basic neural network implementations with different input configurations
- **Multi-Layer Networks** - Deep neural networks with multiple hidden layers
- **MNIST Digit Recognition** - Handwritten digit classification using neural networks
- **Training Utilities** - Helper functions for data processing and training

## Interactive Visualizer

Experience how neural networks learn in real-time with our **[Interactive Neural Network Visualizer](https://ajmaljalal.github.io/Neural_Networks_JS/)**

The visualizer provides step-by-step demonstrations of:
- **Feedforward propagation** - Watch how input data flows through the network
- **Backpropagation** - See how gradients flow backward to update weights
- **Weight updates** - Observe how gradient descent adjusts parameters during training
- **Complete training cycles** - Follow the entire learning process with live updates

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to access the landing page
3. Explore individual neural network implementations in the `.js` files
